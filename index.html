<h2><a href="ece.html">Elastic Calculation Engine</a></h2>
This application demonstrates two task execution mechanisms: a master/worker

structure by which elastic scaling can be demonstrated (for memory usage)
and through which deterministic scaling can be seen (by manually increasing
worker counts).
