<h1>GigaSpaces' Elastic Calculation Engine</h1>
<article>
    <h2>Building</h2>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p>
        The requirements for building the Elastic Calculation Engine are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maven 3</li>
        <li>Java 6</li>
        <li>GigaSpaces XAP 8.0.4 or later</li>
        <li>(optional) git</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Downloading the source</h3>

    <p>
        The source for the GigaSpaces "Best Practices" project, which includes the Elastic Calculation Engine, can be
        retrieved from github with the following command line:
    </p>

    <pre>git clone git@github.com:Gigaspaces/bestpractices.git</pre>

    <h3>Building the application</h3>

    <p>
        To build the application, first make sure you have installed the Maven artifacts for GigaSpaces XAP (which can
        be installed by changing to the GigaSpaces XAP installation directory, then changing to the
        <code>./tools/maven</code> directory, and executing <code>installmavenrep</code> or
        <code>installmavenrep.sh</code>, for Windows and Unix OSes, respectively).
    </p>

    <p>
        Then change to the <code>ElasticCalculationEngine</code> directory in the <code>bestpractices</code> project
        directory, and run Maven:
    </p>

    <pre>mvn package</pre>

    <p>
        After Maven has downloaded its requirements, you should have a fully build Elastic Calculation engine, although
        artifacts will still be located in the subproject directories.
    </p>

    <h2>Running</h2>

    <p>
        There are two primary ways to run the Elastic Calculation Engine client. One is by running an internal GS-Agent,
        and the other is by relying on the Elastic Calculation Engine client application to start the GS-Agent
        internally.
    </p>

    <p>
        Which mode should you prefer? It's entirely up to you. Running the GS-Agent manually removes its lifecycle from
        the client application; there's really no applicable difference after that.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the sake of your sanity and everyone else's, set an environment variable (<code>GSHOME</code>) to the
        GigaSpaces installation directory. Thus <code>echo $GSHOME</code> will show you the GigaSpaces home directory
        location); the Windows equivalent is <code>echo %GSHOME%</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you plan on running the GS-Agent externally to the ECE Client application, go to <code>$GSHOME/bin</code>
        and start an agent:
    </p>
    <pre>rem Windows<br/>gs-agent gsa.gsc 4<br/><br/># UNIX<br/>gs-agent.sh gsa.gsc 4</pre>

    <p>
        To run the client, change to the <code>ElasticCalculationEngine/ece-client/target</code> directory, and run the
        jar:
    </p>

    <pre>java -jar ece-client.jar</pre>

    <p>
        If you chose not to run an external GS-Agent, the client application will attempt to start a managed GS-Agent
        instance, and will poll the Agent until it acquires a valid reference.
    </p>

    <p>
        The remaining steps to run the calculation engine are:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Deploy the stateful processing unit (the data grid)</li>
        <li>Deploy the stateless processing unit (the worker nodes)</li>
        <li>Issue a request for processing trades</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        To deploy the stateful processing unit, choose the "Deployment" tab, and select the "Deploy" button alongside
        the "ece-datagrid" entry.
    </p>

    <p>
        To deploy the stateless processing unit, after the stateful processing unit has deployed, select "Deploy"
        alongside the "ece-worker" entry. You can scale the processing power up and down by adding extra nodes (the
        "Add" and "Remove" buttons).
    </p>

    <p>Running the actual calculations is very simple.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Change to the "Execution" tab.</li>
        <li>"Master/Worker" is the default mode; if you desire the Task Executor mode, check the Executor checkbox.</li>
        <li>Set "Trades" to the value you desire.</li>
        <li>Set "Iterations" to the number of iterations.</li>
        <li>Select "Run."</li>
    </ol>
